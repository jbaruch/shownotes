# Conference Talk Show Notes Platform - Software Definition Document

## Purpose & Vision

### Why This Platform Exists
The Conference Talk Show Notes Platform bridges the gap between in-person presentations and digital resources. It solves the problem of attendees struggling to access talk materials during and after presentations by providing a dedicated, mobile-friendly destination accessible via QR codes or short URLs displayed during talks.

### Core Problem Solved
Conferences generate valuable content that is often lost or difficult to access after the event. This platform:
- Eliminates the "where can I find your slides?" question
- Provides immediate access to resources when they're most relevant
- Creates lasting connections between speakers and attendees
- Ensures talk resources remain available long-term

## User Experience & Flow

### Primary Use Case
1. Attendee sees QR code/short URL during a talk
2. Scans/types URL on mobile device
3. Immediately accesses talk resources (slides, links, etc.)
4. Can subscribe for video notification when available
5. May provide feedback or participate in related offers

### Design Philosophy
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for in-talk viewing on phones
- **Speed-Focused**: Quick loading for conference Wi-Fi scenarios
- **Context-Aware**: Different states based on talk timing (pre/during/post)
- **Simple Navigation**: Clear paths for "presentation listening mode"

## Technical Approach

### Why GitHub Pages
1. **Cost-Effective**: Free hosting eliminates operational expenses
2. **Reliable**: Backed by GitHub's infrastructure
3. **Version-Controlled**: Natural history for all content
4. **Collaboration-Ready**: Built for multiple contributors
5. **Automated**: CI/CD through GitHub Actions

### Why Markdown + Frontmatter
1. **Simple Editing**: Low barrier to entry for content creators
2. **Structured Data**: YAML frontmatter for metadata
3. **Version Control Friendly**: Text-based diffs
4. **Template Compatible**: Works seamlessly with static site generators

### Why Serverless Integrations
1. **Low Maintenance**: No servers to manage
2. **Cost Aligned with Usage**: Pay only for what you use
3. **Scalable**: Handles traffic spikes during conferences
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Core content separate from dynamic features

## Extensibility & Customization

### Configuration-Based Features
The platform uses a plugin-like architecture where features can be enabled/disabled through configuration:
```yaml
features:
  analytics: true|false
  notifications: true|false
  feedback: true|false
  social: true|false
```

### White-Labeling Support
Conferences can customize:
- Visual theming through CSS variables
- Logo and branding elements
- Custom domain support
- Template layouts for different talk types

## Implementation Strategy

### Minimum Viable Product
1. Static site with talk page templates
2. Basic GitHub Issue forms for content creation
3. Core layout for mobile viewing
4. Simple email notification integration

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Content management and basic pages
2. **Phase 2**: Email notifications and feedback forms
3. **Phase 3**: Analytics and engagement features
4. **Phase 4**: Raffle/giveaway automation

### Measuring Success
1. **Adoption Rate**: QR code scans vs. attendance
2. **Engagement**: Time on site, resource downloads
3. **Conversion**: Email signup and feedback submission rates
4. **Speaker Satisfaction**: Ease of use and feature completeness
