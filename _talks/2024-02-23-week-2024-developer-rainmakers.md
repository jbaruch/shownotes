## Abstract

“Developers Are the Rainmakers” zeroes in on the critical role of Developer Relations (DevRel) in shaping effective marketing strategies and fostering organizational growth. This talk will unravel how DevRel extends beyond mere awareness, acting as a key player in enhancing product appeal and adoption across all levels of an organization. We’ll share insights into leveraging bottom-up, product-led growth, and offer guidance on crafting products that naturally encourage this growth model. If you’re keen on grasping the multifaceted impact of DevRel or integrating these approaches into your product strategy, this session is for you.
