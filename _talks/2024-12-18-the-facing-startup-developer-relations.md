## Abstract

DevRel (Developer Relations) isn’t just about talking to developers—it’s about making life easier for everyone in the company. From marketing and sales to R&D and support, DevRel helps build trust, improve products, and attract the right talent. This talk will show how DevRel connects teams, cuts through the noise of traditional marketing, and delivers real value to developers and your company.
We’ll also cover when it makes sense to start investing in DevRel, how to build the right team, and what to look for in a good DevRel hire. If you’re a founder or investor looking to understand how DevRel can align your whole company around better developer engagement, this session has you covered.
