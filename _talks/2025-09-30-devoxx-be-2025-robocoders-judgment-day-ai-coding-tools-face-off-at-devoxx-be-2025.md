## Abstract

Can AI-powered coding tools take software development to the next level? Unlike traditional code assistants that provide suggestions or guidance, AI-driven coding tools like Windsurf, JetBrains Junie, Antropic Claude, and OpenAI Codex promise to act as full-fledged agents capable of handling entire workflows. In this live showdown, we're putting that promise to the test by challenging these tools to build a smart light bulb controller—something we've never developed before.

From setting up the project and implementing features to testing, debugging, and optimizing, the AI will take the reins. The audience will decide the winner based on how well the tools perform and, of course, whether the demo actually works.

Join us to see if AI coding tools can deliver on their bold promise of transforming development, or if they're just another stepping stone on the path to something bigger.
