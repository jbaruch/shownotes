## Abstract

Clean code isn’t just about eliminating bugs and reducing technical debt—it’s a secret weapon for boosting developer productivity. SonarSource has championed quality and security, but an untapped dimension is Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE). Let’s explore how reframing ‘clean code’ can be SonarSource’s next giant stride in enhancing developer workflows and happiness.
