## Abstract

Great Scott! The robots are coming for your job—and this time, they brought unit tests. Join Doc and Marty from the Software Future (Baruch and Leonid) as they race back in time to help you fight the machines using only your domain expertise, a well-structured prompt, and a pinch of Gherkin. This keynote is your survival guide for the AI age: how to close the intent-to-prompt chasm before it swallows your roadmap, how to weaponize the Intent Integrity Chain to steer AI output safely, and why the Art of the Possible is your most powerful resistance tool. Expect:

Bad puns
Good tests
Wild demos

And a new way to look at AI—not as your overlord, but your intern (on a short leash) The machines may be fast. But with structure, constraint, and a little time travel, you’ll still be the one writing the future.
