## Abstract

Can AI-powered IDEs take software development to the next level? Unlike traditional code assistants that provide suggestions or guidance, AI-driven IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf promise to act as full-fledged agents capable of handling entire workflows. In this live showdown, we’re putting that promise to the test by challenging these tools to build a smart light bulb controller—something we’ve never developed before.
From setting up the project and implementing features to testing, debugging, and optimizing, the AI will take the reins. This isn’t about helping—it’s about doing. The audience will decide the winner based on how well the tools perform and, of course, whether the demo actually works.
Join us to see if AI IDEs can deliver on their bold promise of transforming development, or if they’re just another stepping stone on the path to something bigger.
