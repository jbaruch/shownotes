abstract: |
  Did you notice how everything in IT is crap right now? Services are bloated, slow, and buggy,
  and the hardware requirements to run even the simplest applications are enormous. This presentation
  explores the root causes of technical decline in our industry - from bloated services to
  unreasonable hardware requirements. We'll examine why developer productivity is suffering and
  discuss practical strategies to reverse these negative trends and build better technology.
