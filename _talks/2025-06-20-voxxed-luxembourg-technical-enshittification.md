Did you notice how everything in IT is crap right now? Services are bloated, slow, and buggy, and the hardware requirements to run even the simplest applications are enormous. This presentation explores the root causes of technical decline in our industry - from bloated services to unreasonable hardware requirements. We'll examine why developer productivity is suffering and discuss practical strategies to reverse these negative trends and build better technology.
