# Microservices in Production

While microservices offer many benefits, successful implementation requires careful attention to service boundaries, communication patterns, and operational concerns.

## Core Patterns

### Service Design
- Domain-driven design principles
- Single responsibility per service
- Database per service pattern

### Communication
- Synchronous vs asynchronous patterns
- Event-driven architectures
- Circuit breaker implementation

### Deployment
- Container orchestration strategies
- Service mesh integration
- Blue-green deployments

## Lessons Learned

The biggest challenge in microservices isn't technical - it's organizational. Services should be aligned with team boundaries to minimize coordination overhead.
