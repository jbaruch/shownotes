## Latest Deploy Workflow Fix

### Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Deploy workflow failing with YAML validation error

  - `contents: read`
  - `pages: write` 
  - `id-token: write`

### Testing Results
- Manual workflow trigger: âœ… SUCCESS (YAML now valid)
- Auto-triggered workflows: ðŸ”„ TESTING IN PROGRESS
