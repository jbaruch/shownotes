# Product Context - Conference Talk Show Notes Platform

## Purpose & Vision

The Conference Talk Show Notes Platform bridges the gap between in-person presentations and digital resources. It solves the problem of attendees struggling to access talk materials during and after presentations by providing a dedicated, mobile-friendly destination accessible via QR codes or short URLs displayed during talks.

## Core Problem Statement

Conferences generate valuable content that is often lost or difficult to access after the event. This platform eliminates the "where can I find your slides?" question by providing immediate access to resources when they're most relevant, creating lasting connections between speakers and attendees while ensuring talk resources remain available long-term.

2. **Quick Check**: Scans/types URL to verify it works and bookmark for later
3. **Bookmark/Share**: Saves URL to share with colleagues after the talk
4. **Post-Talk Return**: Comes back later to access resources and sign up for notifications
5. **Video Release**: Returns when video is published to re-watch and share
6. **Extended Sharing**: Shares resources with broader network over time
