## Test-First Development Workflow

1. **Test Scenarios** (this document) define WHAT to test - **121 scenarios covering all 31 requirements**
2. **Gherkin Features** will define HOW to test (user-readable specifications)
3. **Test Implementation** will create failing tests that specify exact behavior
4. **Code Implementation** will make those tests pass

This ensures that every line of code serves a tested requirement and that specifications drive implementation rather than the reverse.
