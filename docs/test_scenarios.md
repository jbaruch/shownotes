```

### From REQ-2.1.1: Jekyll Implementation

**Test Scenarios:**
- **TS-028**: Site builds successfully with Jekyll

## Test Implementation Requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements
Each test scenario MUST:
1. Map directly to a specific requirement
2. Have clear, measurable success criteria
3. Be implementable as automated tests where possible
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Cover error conditions and edge cases

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Jekyll build process and template rendering
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load time and resource optimization
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance validation
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Compatibility matrix validation

### Test Data Requirements
- **Sample Talk Content**: Various frontmatter configurations
- **Edge Cases**: Missing fields, malformed data, special characters
- **Performance Scenarios**: Large content, slow networks, multiple resources
- **Browser Matrix**: All required browser/device combinations

## Test-First Development Workflow

1. **Test Scenarios** (this document) define WHAT to test
2. **Gherkin Features** will define HOW to test (user-readable specifications)
3. **Test Implementation** will create failing tests that specify exact behavior
4. **Code Implementation** will make those tests pass

This ensures that every line of code serves a tested requirement and that specifications drive implementation rather than the reverse.
