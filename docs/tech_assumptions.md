# Technical Assumptions - Conference Talk Show Notes Platform

## Platform Selection Assumptions

### Static Site Generator
**Assumption**: Jekyll will be the primary static site generator
**Rationale**: 
- Native GitHub Pages support
- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin library
- Ruby-based, well-documented
- Excellent Markdown and Liquid template support

**Risk**: Limited JavaScript ecosystem compared to React/Vue alternatives
**Mitigation**: Evaluate Next.js/Nuxt.js as alternatives if JS-heavy features needed

### Hosting Platform
**Assumption**: GitHub Pages provides sufficient hosting capabilities
**Rationale**:
- Zero cost for public repositories
- Automatic SSL/TLS certificates
- Built-in CDN distribution
- Seamless integration with GitHub workflow

**Risk**: Limited server-side processing, custom headers restrictions
**Mitigation**: Use serverless functions for dynamic features

## Development Workflow Assumptions

### Content Management
**Assumption**: Speaker manages own content via GitHub/Markdown
**Rationale**:
- Personal speaking archive, not multi-user platform
- Speaker has technical familiarity for content management
- Version control useful for tracking talk evolution over time
- Simple workflow for post-talk resource updates

**Risk**: Workflow complexity for quick updates
**Mitigation**: Simple file structure, template-based approach

### Build Process
**Assumption**: GitHub Actions provides sufficient CI/CD capabilities
**Rationale**:
- Free for public repositories
- Integrated with GitHub Pages
- Extensive marketplace of actions

**Risk**: Build time limitations, complex workflow debugging
**Mitigation**: Keep build processes simple, optimize for speed

## Performance Assumptions

### Traffic Patterns (Simplified)
**Assumption**: Very low traffic volume (~100s of visits per shownotes total)
**Rationale**:
- Personal speaking archive, not high-traffic conference platform
- Individual talk pages with limited audience
- GitHub Pages default performance sufficient

**Risk**: None - traffic expectations are very conservative
**Mitigation**: No special optimization needed

### Mobile Performance (Basic)
**Assumption**: Standard responsive design sufficient for bookmark/share workflow
**Rationale**:
- Usage is quick check during talk, main usage post-talk
- No real-time performance pressure during presentations
- Jekyll default templates handle mobile bookmarking well
- Users return later when they have better connectivity

**Risk**: Minor usability issues during quick verification
**Mitigation**: Keep pages simple, ensure core content loads first

## Integration Assumptions

### Email Service
**Assumption**: Third-party email service integration is necessary
**Rationale**:
- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side email
- Need reliable transactional email delivery
- Newsletter/notification functionality required

**Risk**: Additional cost and complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with simple service, evaluate cost/benefit

### Analytics
**Assumption**: Privacy-focused analytics preferred over Google Analytics
**Rationale**:
- GDPR compliance easier with privacy-first tools
- Reduced cookie consent requirements
- Better user privacy alignment

**Risk**: Less detailed analytics data
**Mitigation**: Focus on essential metrics, supplement with server logs

## Security Assumptions

### Static Site Security
**Assumption**: Static sites are inherently more secure than dynamic sites
**Rationale**:
- No server-side vulnerabilities
- Limited attack surface
- Content served from CDN

**Risk**: Client-side vulnerabilities, compromised build process
**Mitigation**: CSP headers, dependency scanning, secure build pipeline

### Content Privacy
**Assumption**: All talk content will be publicly accessible
**Rationale**:
- Conference talks are typically public presentations
- QR codes imply open access
- Simplifies access control

**Risk**: Speakers may want private/protected content
**Mitigation**: Document assumption clearly, plan for auth if needed

## Scalability Assumptions (Simplified)

### Usage Scale
**Assumption**: Personal speaking archive with minimal traffic
**Rationale**:
- ~100s of visits per shownotes page total
- Individual speaker's talk archive, not conference platform
- GitHub Pages free tier more than sufficient

**Risk**: None - usage well within GitHub Pages limits
**Mitigation**: No scaling considerations needed for Phase 1

### Growth Pattern
**Assumption**: Gradual evolution from simple to full-featured
**Rationale**:
- Phase 1: Single page proof of concept
- Phase 2: Migration focus, still low traffic
- Phase 3: Advanced features when/if needed

**Risk**: Feature creep could complicate simple approach
**Mitigation**: Maintain focus on simplicity, add complexity only when proven necessary

## Technology Lifecycle Assumptions

### Long-term Maintenance
**Assumption**: Platform should remain maintainable with minimal ongoing effort
**Rationale**:
- Static sites require less maintenance than dynamic applications
- Dependency updates are primary maintenance task
- GitHub provides long-term platform stability

**Risk**: Technology obsolescence, security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**: Regular dependency updates, simple technology choices

### Migration Path
**Assumption**: Platform architecture allows future migration if needed
**Rationale**:
- Markdown content is portable
- Git history provides migration data
- Static site generators are interchangeable

**Risk**: Feature-specific lock-in to platform
**Mitigation**: Avoid platform-specific features, document migration procedures

## Feature Scope Assumptions

### MVP Features
**Assumption**: Basic talk pages with resources meet initial user needs
**Rationale**:
- Solves core problem of resource access
- Provides immediate value to users
- Establishes platform foundation

**Risk**: Feature requests exceed simple scope
**Mitigation**: Clear feature roadmap, iterative development

### Advanced Features
**Assumption**: Email notifications and feedback forms are essential second-tier features
**Rationale**:
- Extend platform value beyond conference event
- Enable speaker-attendee connection
- Provide conference organizer insights

**Risk**: Complexity may compromise core functionality
**Mitigation**: Modular design, feature flags, phased rollout
