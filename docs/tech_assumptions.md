# Technical Assumptions - Conference Talk Show Notes Platform

## Platform Selection Assumptions

### Static Site Generator
**Assumption**: Jekyll will be the primary static site generator
**Rationale**: 
- Native GitHub Pages support
- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin library
- Ruby-based, well-documented
- Excellent Markdown and Liquid template support

**Risk**: Limited JavaScript ecosystem compared to React/Vue alternatives
**Mitigation**: Evaluate Next.js/Nuxt.js as alternatives if JS-heavy features needed

### Hosting Platform
**Assumption**: GitHub Pages provides sufficient hosting capabilities
**Rationale**:
- Zero cost for public repositories
- Automatic SSL/TLS certificates
- Built-in CDN distribution
- Seamless integration with GitHub workflow

**Risk**: Limited server-side processing, custom headers restrictions
**Mitigation**: Use serverless functions for dynamic features

## Development Workflow Assumptions

### Content Management
**Assumption**: Non-technical users can manage content via GitHub web interface
**Rationale**:
- GitHub provides user-friendly editing for Markdown
- Version control built-in
- Collaborative editing with pull requests

**Risk**: Learning curve for non-developers
**Mitigation**: Provide comprehensive documentation and training

### Build Process
**Assumption**: GitHub Actions provides sufficient CI/CD capabilities
**Rationale**:
- Free for public repositories
- Integrated with GitHub Pages
- Extensive marketplace of actions

**Risk**: Build time limitations, complex workflow debugging
**Mitigation**: Keep build processes simple, optimize for speed

## Performance Assumptions

### Traffic Patterns
**Assumption**: Conference traffic follows predictable spike patterns
**Rationale**:
- Conferences have scheduled talks
- QR code scans concentrate during presentations
- Traffic drops significantly post-conference

**Risk**: Unexpected viral content or social media sharing
**Mitigation**: CDN caching, static site inherently scalable

### Mobile Performance
**Assumption**: Conference Wi-Fi will be slow and unreliable
**Rationale**:
- Conferences often have overloaded networks
- Mobile devices are primary access method
- Users need quick access during talks

**Risk**: Complex pages may not load quickly
**Mitigation**: Aggressive optimization, critical CSS, minimal JavaScript

## Integration Assumptions

### Email Service
**Assumption**: Third-party email service integration is necessary
**Rationale**:
- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side email
- Need reliable transactional email delivery
- Newsletter/notification functionality required

**Risk**: Additional cost and complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with simple service, evaluate cost/benefit

### Analytics
**Assumption**: Privacy-focused analytics preferred over Google Analytics
**Rationale**:
- GDPR compliance easier with privacy-first tools
- Reduced cookie consent requirements
- Better user privacy alignment

**Risk**: Less detailed analytics data
**Mitigation**: Focus on essential metrics, supplement with server logs

## Security Assumptions

### Static Site Security
**Assumption**: Static sites are inherently more secure than dynamic sites
**Rationale**:
- No server-side vulnerabilities
- Limited attack surface
- Content served from CDN

**Risk**: Client-side vulnerabilities, compromised build process
**Mitigation**: CSP headers, dependency scanning, secure build pipeline

### Content Privacy
**Assumption**: All talk content will be publicly accessible
**Rationale**:
- Conference talks are typically public presentations
- QR codes imply open access
- Simplifies access control

**Risk**: Speakers may want private/protected content
**Mitigation**: Document assumption clearly, plan for auth if needed

## Scalability Assumptions

### Conference Size
**Assumption**: Platform will serve conferences of 100-10,000 attendees
**Rationale**:
- Covers most conference sizes
- GitHub Pages can handle this traffic
- CDN provides global distribution

**Risk**: Larger conferences may need different architecture
**Mitigation**: Monitor usage patterns, plan architecture evolution

### Growth Pattern
**Assumption**: Platform will grow gradually from single to multiple conferences
**Rationale**:
- Allows iterative improvement
- Validates assumptions before large-scale deployment
- Reduces technical risk

**Risk**: Multi-tenancy complexity if rapid growth occurs
**Mitigation**: Design with multi-conference support from start

## Technology Lifecycle Assumptions

### Long-term Maintenance
**Assumption**: Platform should remain maintainable with minimal ongoing effort
**Rationale**:
- Static sites require less maintenance than dynamic applications
- Dependency updates are primary maintenance task
- GitHub provides long-term platform stability

**Risk**: Technology obsolescence, security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**: Regular dependency updates, simple technology choices

### Migration Path
**Assumption**: Platform architecture allows future migration if needed
**Rationale**:
- Markdown content is portable
- Git history provides migration data
- Static site generators are interchangeable

**Risk**: Feature-specific lock-in to platform
**Mitigation**: Avoid platform-specific features, document migration procedures

## Feature Scope Assumptions

### MVP Features
**Assumption**: Basic talk pages with resources meet initial user needs
**Rationale**:
- Solves core problem of resource access
- Provides immediate value to users
- Establishes platform foundation

**Risk**: Feature requests exceed simple scope
**Mitigation**: Clear feature roadmap, iterative development

### Advanced Features
**Assumption**: Email notifications and feedback forms are essential second-tier features
**Rationale**:
- Extend platform value beyond conference event
- Enable speaker-attendee connection
- Provide conference organizer insights

**Risk**: Complexity may compromise core functionality
**Mitigation**: Modular design, feature flags, phased rollout
