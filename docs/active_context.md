# Active Context - Conference Talk Show Notes Platform

## Current Phase: Analysis (Phase 1)

**Status**: Completing Analysis Phase
**Start Date**: 2025-08-20
**Phase Goal**: Analyze requirements, define boundaries, document assumptions

## Completed Analysis Tasks

### ✅ Requirements Analysis
- Analyzed software definition document
- Identified core user journeys and pain points
- Documented success metrics and business goals
- Defined primary and secondary user personas

### ✅ Project Boundaries Definition
- **In Scope**: Static site generation, mobile-first design, QR code access, email notifications, feedback forms
- **Out of Scope**: Conference management system, payment processing, complex user authentication, real-time features
- **MVP Boundaries**: Basic talk pages, resource access, GitHub-based content management

### ✅ Architecture Documentation
- Defined Static Site + Serverless architecture pattern
- Identified GitHub Pages + Jekyll as core technology choice
- Planned serverless integration points for dynamic features
- Documented scalability and security approaches

### ✅ Technical Context Establishment
- Technology stack selection and rationale
- Integration requirements with external services
- Performance and browser support requirements
- Development environment specifications

### ✅ Assumptions Documentation
- Platform selection assumptions (Jekyll, GitHub Pages)
- Development workflow assumptions (GitHub-based content management)
- Performance assumptions (conference traffic patterns, mobile-first)
- Security and privacy assumptions (public content, static site security)

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Decisions
1. **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll (GitHub Pages native support)
2. **Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages (cost-effective, reliable)
3. **Content Format**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter
4. **Build System**: GitHub Actions CI/CD
5. **Dynamic Features**: Serverless functions for email/forms

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Primary optimization for mobile devices
2. **CDN-First Delivery**: Leverage GitHub Pages built-in CDN
3. **Git-Based Workflow**: Version controlled content management
4. **Modular Features**: Plugin-like architecture for extensibility
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript

### Scope Decisions
1. **MVP Focus**: Talk pages with resource access
2. **Phased Rollout**: Email notifications and feedback in Phase 2
3. **Multi-Conference**: Design for eventual multi-tenancy
4. **White-Label Support**: Conference customization capabilities
5. **Privacy-First**: GDPR-compliant analytics and data handling

## Current Understanding

### Core Problem
Conference attendees struggle to access talk materials during and after presentations, leading to lost resources and missed connections between speakers and attendees.

### Solution Approach
Provide a mobile-optimized platform accessible via QR codes during talks, offering immediate access to resources with optional email notifications for follow-up content.

### Success Criteria
- Quick page loads on conference Wi-Fi (< 2.5s LCP)
- High adoption rate (QR code scans vs attendance)
- Easy content management for non-technical users
- Scalable to handle conference traffic spikes

## Next Phase Preparation

### Ready for Specification Phase
- Requirements clearly documented
- Architecture patterns established
- Technology choices validated
- Assumptions documented and risks identified

### Phase 2 Prerequisites
- All analysis documentation complete
- Version control established and phase tagged
- No protected file violations occurred
- User approval required before proceeding

## Outstanding Questions

### For User Clarification
1. Preferred email service provider for notifications
2. Analytics preference (privacy-focused vs full-featured)
3. Conference branding requirements specificity
4. Multi-language support requirements

### Technical Validation Needed
1. GitHub Pages custom domain setup complexity
2. Serverless function provider selection
3. Email template design requirements
4. QR code generation approach (client vs server)

## Risk Register

### High Priority Risks
1. **Conference Wi-Fi Performance**: Mitigation through aggressive optimization
2. **Non-Technical User Adoption**: Mitigation through documentation and training
3. **Build Time Scalability**: Mitigation through optimized build processes

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Jekyll vs Modern Framework**: Plan migration path if JavaScript ecosystem needed
2. **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Serverless functions for dynamic features
3. **Email Service Costs**: Start simple, evaluate alternatives

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Multi-Conference Complexity**: Design modularly from start
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Static sites reduce attack surface
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement approach

## Phase Completion Status

**Analysis Phase**: ✅ Complete
- All required documentation created
- Technical decisions documented
- Assumptions and risks identified
- Project boundaries clearly defined

**Next Phase**: Specification Phase (awaiting user approval)
- Write Gherkin feature specifications
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Create test scenarios documentation
- Document detailed requirements
