```bash
cd utils/google_drive
ruby delete_google_drive_file.rb FILE_ID
```

**Features:**
- Safely deletes individual files
- Confirms deletion before proceeding
- Handles API errors gracefully

### force_delete_files.rb

Force deletes multiple files from Google Drive (use with caution).

**Usage:**
```bash
cd utils/google_drive

```

**Features:**
- Batch deletion of multiple files
- Confirmation prompts for safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- Dry-run mode available

## Common Use Cases

### Re-migration Scenario

When you need to re-migrate a talk (e.g., source content changed):

1. **Clean up old files:**
   ```bash
   cd utils/google_drive
   ruby cleanup_google_drive.rb
   # Select files to delete from previous migration
   ```

2. **Re-run migration:**
   ```bash
   cd utils/migration
   ruby migrate_talk.rb https://speaking.jbaru.ch/TALK_ID
   ```

3. **Validate results:**
   ```bash
   cd utils/migration
   ruby test_real_site.rb
   ```

### Google Drive Maintenance

Regular cleanup of Google Drive to manage storage:

```bash
cd utils/google_drive
ruby cleanup_google_drive.rb
# Review and delete outdated or duplicate files
```

### Testing Migration Quality

After migration, validate the results:

```bash
cd utils/migration
ruby test_real_site.rb

# Also run the comprehensive test suite
cd ../..
bundle exec ruby test/run_tests.rb --category migration
```

## Configuration

All scripts require `Google API.json` file in the project root for Google Drive access.

### Required Environment
- Ruby 3.4+
- Google Drive API credentials
- Network access to noti.st and target sites

### Dependencies
- `google-apis-drive_v3`
- `googleauth`
- `nokogiri`
- `yaml`
- `json`

## Security Notes

- **Google API credentials**: Keep `Google API.json` secure and never commit to version control
- **Deletion scripts**: Use with extreme caution, especially `force_delete_files.rb`
- **Network requests**: All scripts make external API calls and network requests
- **File operations**: Scripts modify local files and remote Google Drive content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Google API Quota Exceeded:**
- Wait for quota reset (usually 24 hours)
- Use cleanup scripts to reduce API calls
- Contact Google for quota increase if needed

**Network Connectivity:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify noti.st site accessibility
- Test Google Drive API connectivity

**File Permissions:**
- Ensure scripts have execute permissions
- Check Google Drive folder permissions
- Verify API credentials have correct scopes

**Migration Failures:**
- Check source URL accessibility
- Verify Google Drive folder exists
- Review error logs for specific issues
